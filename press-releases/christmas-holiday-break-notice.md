## NOTICE FROM THE SUPREME COURT

Today, the Supreme Court has adopted a proclamation to close the Court and the lower courts for the holidays from December 23rd to December 26th. During this time, the courthouse will be closed to the public and all hearings and proceedings will be postponed until the court resumes its regular schedule.

Any filings related to cases before the Supreme Court must be filed before the holiday period to be timely heard. Any petitions for certiorari or notices of appeal filed will not be heard until after the conclusion of the 2022 A.D. Term.

The Mayflower Supreme Court would like to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday season. We look forward to serving the community in the new year and thank the public for their understanding during this brief hiatus.
