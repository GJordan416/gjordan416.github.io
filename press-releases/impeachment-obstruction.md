**For Immediate Release**\
March 29, 2023


## NOTICE FROM THE SUPREME COURT

On March 28th, the Immigration and Customs Force deported a party involved in an ongoing impeachment matter. Hours later, leadership with the Mayflower State Police and of the Immigrations and Customs Force began communicating with impeachment managers in an effort to likely influence their work. These efforts are, at the very least, annoyances to the judicial process and, at worse, a criminal offense. 

The Supreme Court is concerned that these actions were done in an attempt to disrupt the ongoing legal process and undermine the independence of the judiciary. While we recognize that the immigrations system is responsible for maintaining the integrity of our community, it is essential that their actions do not impede the ability of the courts to carry out their constitutionally mandated functions. This public notice serves as a reminder to members of the general public not to engage, communicate, or attempt to bribe parties of a case in a matter that may influence the law. We would like to remind all parties that the separation of powers is a fundamental principle that must be respected.

The Court Marshal's Office has been directed to maintain vigilance and an investigation to any other attempts to violate the sancitiy of the Court and to recommend any charges necessary to preserve the institution of the Court's processes. The Court is also prepared to take necessary action to maintain the status quo.

We thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
