		<h1>PRESS RELEASE REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW</h1>
		<p>The Supreme Court reviewed and granted an application for preliminary injunction in Docket No. 7-12. This sensitive matter is a legal question as to the extent of the Central Authority's immunity when it takes actions at the request of player government. This injunction is a critical component of the rule of law and the court's ability to protect the rights of all citizens. In response to the injunction, the Central Authority has explicitly stated that it will veto the order and any actions to enforce it will be met with moderation action. The Supreme Court, and the rest of the judiciary at-large, has taken note of this.</p>
		<p>Justice TaxesArentAwesome provided the following statement:</p>
		<div style="display: block; padding-left: 40px;">
		<p>The protections of our State Constitution were written specifically to protect against these circumventions. Absolutely nobody should be cheering the side of the Government nor the Central Authority's contempt towards this court, not even their most ardent supporters. For someone to support these actions is to support the eventual destruction of this community. The empowerment of a weapon which could deport, silence, and remove any member of the community on just mere criminal accusations is not in the public interest, it never will be.</p>
		<p>Article X explicitly lays out the powers of the Central Authority when it comes to Player Government. From time to time, they are allowed to go beyond those guidelines when it comes to issues of state security. The Court acknowledges this and is not here to construe the Constitution as a suicide pact. There are times where intervention is required, such as for election security. But when the cause of their interference is general law enforcement, they have entered the tightly guarded space of Player Government. Those that have been misled continue to say that the Central Authority is justified because they made the order and have a right to enforce it. To those I say: where would you stand on this issue if it were your position in the community placed in jeopardy?</p>
		<p>In about fourteen hours, the Immigrations and Customs Force will decide whether it will force the hand that pulls the trigger of the gun pointed towards the People of Mayflower. Their action may have the blessings of the Central Authority, but it does not have the consent of the governed. If they choose to comply with the mandate, history will look upon them favorably as the valient enforcers that understand that they are not infallible, that they can make mistake and should err to the side of caution and abidance of law. If they refuse, however, there will be no history. Even if they say that the choice is not in their hands, they are the ones who authored and enforced the decision.</p>
		</div>
		<p>At this current time, the order remains in effect.</p>
