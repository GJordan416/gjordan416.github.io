        <p1><strong>For Immediate Release</strong><br>August 4, 2023</p1>
		    <h1>PRESS RELEASE REGARDING THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY</h1>
		    <p>In no other group has its management team taken such a nuclear approach to upholding its own will over the player government that is tasked with the day-to-day operations. On July 2nd, the Central Authority banned Associate Justice TaxesArentAwesome for directing the lower court to reject its immunity claim on an election-related litigation which was properly being handled through the courts system. Admittedly, Justice Taxes did use foul language that was unbecoming of a member of the Supreme Court, but such language, if used by a normal community member, would have never resulted in a community removal. One must question the steep punishment that was handed in this instance. The only answer that can be found was that it was done to silence a rebellious member questioning the Central Authority's immunity.</p>
        <p>Ironically, this event falls just shy of the two-year anniversary of the day where the Mayflower Supreme Court in the original rendition of Mayflower resigned in protest of the Central Authority's overreach and inflated ego that eventually led to the collapse of their player government. History tells us that these results are just near in the future as the Central Authority digs their heels in to continue polarizing the political landscape between two sides — those that see this as an injustice and those that are power-hungry to fill the vacancies of ranks created by this event.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the biggest losers in this event will be the player that spent painstaking time in building this group up and providing their services for the jobs that require labor. The Central Authority will not lose in this event because they are too short-sided to see their losses that pile before them. The only person that loses will be the State Senator who wrote bills for the betterment of this group, the reoccuring litigant who spent time on writing their pleadings in this group, and the government official who, without them, would cripple this group of the bureaucratic workers. These people, who put in dozens of hours of work for their position, will be left abandoned as they witness the player government collapse around them.</p>
        <p>The Central Authority has already began plans to replace members of the judiciary that strike to make their voice heard against injustices like this. These plans have already leaked and the names of future members have been known.</p>
		    <p>To Clifford, Tony, Stick, Dave, Zac, and any other person that has been offered or asked for a seat to replace the current judiciary:</p>
		    <div style="display: block; padding-left: 40px;">
		      <p>Do not compromise your beliefs to take this job. You are soon to undertake a thankless job where the pool of competent litigants will dry up because they will refuse to work in a system where the opposition is silenced, banned, and stopped at every turn by the Central Authority. You, yourselves, will also be the target of this scrutiny where the slightest moment where you are positioned to rule against the Central Authority or their friends, you will be asked to rule the opposite way or risk your job.</p>
          <p>Take it from the people that are now being forced out of the seats you are soon set to occupy. In the AA_MP impeachment, we were continiously asked to rule in favor of the Colonel or risk our own impeachment. We were asked repeatedly to recuse and to dismiss the impeachment or face action on our own positions. In the M1keaswell impeachment that currently occupies the docket, we faced the same issue as the previous one. We were repeatedly asked to recuse and dismiss the impeachment or face action.</p>
          <p>The system you are soon set to adopt is one absent justice and independence where your decision, in the important matters, are essentially decided for you already by the powers above. If you take the seat that is being dangled in front of you, you will serve as nothing but a pawn to this fight. Do not allow this precedent to continue where the Central Authority, at their own decision and will, can remove the entire Supreme Court for whatever reason they see. The strike must continue and the Central Authority must be brought back to compliance with the rule of law. There is but no other option.</p>

		<p>Let justice remain the rule of law, not intolerant autocracy.</p>
